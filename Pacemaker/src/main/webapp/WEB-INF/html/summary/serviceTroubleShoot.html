	        </accordion-heading>
	        There are typically two types of timeouts that should be set when making calls over the web: the Connection Timeout and the Socket Timeout. 
			The Connection Timeout is the maximum amount of time that should be allowed when establishing the bi-directional socket connection between the client and server.  
			Behind the scenes socket connection involves resolving the domain name of the server to an IP address, and then the server opening a port to 
			connect with the client’s port.

	        </accordion-heading>
	        The Socket Timeout is the timeout that limits the amount of time each socket operation is allowed to take.  
			It limits the amount of time InputStream.read() will listen for a server’s response.  
			If a server is faulty or overloaded it may take a long time (or forever) to respond to a request. 
			This timeout limits the amount of time the client will wait for the server to respond.
			When making any calls from a Custom Object to an external server (either making WebService calls, or FTP transfers), 
			you should always set the Connection Timeout and the Socket Timeout.  Always try to keep the timeouts as reasonably small as possible.  
			Failure to do so could unexpectedly impact your server.  Consider a Custom Object that takes an average of 10 seconds to run is called 
			to make an external WebService call once a minute. This will not cause any issues and the  system will be stable.  
			If the external server suddenly has a performance degredation and now the external WebService call takes over a minute to run, 
			the execution queue will eventually fill, causing performance degradation to your system.  
			To protect against this scenario, set the timeouts to limit the call to one minute, and log whenever the time limit is exceeded
